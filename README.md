# SidoComms-movie-acquization

You and your business partner were recently approached by another local business 
owner who is interested in purchasing your Movies Rental Business. He primarily owns 
restaurant and bars, so he has lots of questions for you about your business and the rental 
business in general. His offer seems very generous, so you are going to entertain his 
questions. 
Leverage your SQL skills to extract and analyze data from various tables in the Movies 
Database to answer you potential Acquirerâ€™s questions. Each question will require you to 
write a multi-table SQL query, joining at least two tables.

# **The letter**

Dear Sidocomms Movies Management,
I am excited about the potential acquisition and learning more about your rental business.
Please bear with me as I am new to the industry. I have a number of questions for you.
Assuming you can answer them all, and that there are no major surprises, we should be able to 
move forward with the purchase.
Best,
Elijah Moneybags
